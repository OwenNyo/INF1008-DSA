# üöå INF1008 - Bus Route Optimization & Booking Project

## üåç Overview
This project focuses on optimizing bus commuter routes from the airport to various hotels, aiming to minimize **time**, **cost**, and **distance**, while also reducing **CO2 emissions**. Additionally, users can **book bus appointments** and **sign themselves up** through the app. Future work will expand the features to further improve environmental and operational efficiencies.

## üéØ Project Goals
- **Route Optimization**: Calculate the most efficient bus routes using advanced algorithms.
- **Bus Appointment Booking**: Allow users to schedule bus rides directly through the app.
- **Minimize Travel Time**: Ensure faster routes to reduce commute times.
- **Reduce CO2 Emissions**: Optimize routes for minimal environmental impact.
- **User Sign-up**: Provide a system for users to register and manage their bookings.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Efficient Pathfinding**: Uses **Dijkstra's Algorithm** and **A\*** for finding the shortest and most cost-effective routes.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Manages and prioritizes routes based on time, cost, or CO2 emissions.
- **Bus Appointment System**: Users can book bus rides from the airport to their hotel of choice.
- **User Sign-up**: Users can create accounts and manage their travel bookings easily.
- **CO2 Emission Tracking**: Calculate and minimize the carbon footprint for each route.
- **Real-time Traffic Management**: Incorporate real-time traffic data for route optimization.
- **Scalable for Future Work**: Designed for future enhancements like dynamic traffic updates and ride-sharing integration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Technologies
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Used to find the shortest paths between the airport and various hotels.
- **A\*** Algorithm: An advanced pathfinding technique to improve efficiency and accuracy in route selection.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Applied to prioritize and manage optimal routes based on criteria like time, cost, and emissions.
- **User Management**: A system for user sign-up, login, and booking management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Files
- `app.py`: The main application to handle route optimization and user bookings.
- `trafficFunctions.py`: Core algorithms (Dijkstra, A*, sorting) for route calculation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies needed to run the project.
- `static/`: Holds static resources like images and styles.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for the web interface, including booking and sign-up forms.

## üö¶ Future Enhancements
- **Dynamic Traffic Data Integration**: Include real-time traffic updates for more accurate route planning.
- **User Customization**: Let users choose between different optimization goals like fastest route or most eco-friendly route.
- **Multi-modal Transport**: Expand the system to integrate multiple transport options (e.g., buses, ride-sharing, biking).

## üå± Environmental Impact
One of the core objectives of this project is to reduce **CO2 emissions** by optimizing routes that save time and improve fuel efficiency. The project will continue to evolve to make public transportation systems more environmentally sustainable.
